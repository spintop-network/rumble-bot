The attack made @kaybeden miscalculate the attack's direction. As a result, he created a gravity field by using his GRAVITATIONAL ABSORBER in the wrong place to deflect the attack.	@kaybeden's GRAVITATIONAL ABSORBER was ineffective. @kazanan used his attack's momentum to create a vacuum within the gravity field that @kaybeden's GRAVITATIONAL ABSORBER created.
