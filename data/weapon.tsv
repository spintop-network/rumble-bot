The nanobots coordinated successfully, forming a concentrated swarm that surrounded @kaybeden's Cobot. Their microscopic assaults penetrated the armor and disrupted vital components, causing significant damage and weakening the Cobot.	@kazanan's NANOBOT SWARM GUIDANCE SYSTEM was very effective. The nanobots acted as an unstoppable swarm, completely engulfing @kaybeden's Cobot. Their relentless attacks dismantled the Cobot from within, leaving it inoperable and beyond repair for the foreseeable future.
					
					
NUCLEAR WARHEAD	@kazanan's NUCLEAR WARHEAD was impotent. Due to a technical glitch, the nuclear warhead failed to detonate as intended. The missile carrying the warhead harmlessly veered off-course, detonating harmlessly in a remote location far from @kaybeden's Cobot.	@kazanan's NUCLEAR WARHEAD was ineffective. The nuclear warhead detonated, but the blast was mitigated by @kaybeden's Cobot's advanced shielding and defensive capabilities. The explosion caused some superficial damage to the outer armor, leaving scorch marks, but it was far from a critical hit.	@kazanan's NUCLEAR WARHEAD was barely effective. The nuclear warhead detonated with significant force, enveloping @kaybeden's Cobot in the blast radius. The Cobot's shielding managed to absorb most of the radiation and heat, but some internal systems suffered damage, impacting its overall performance.	@kazanan's NUCLEAR WARHEAD was effective.

REALITY WARPER	@kazanan's REALITY WARPER was impotent. The attempt to manipulate reality had minimal effect, and @kaybeden's Cobot remained unaffected. It seemed that @kazanan's control over reality was fleeting, and the manipulation lacked the necessary strength to cause any notable changes.	@kazanan's REALITY WARPER was ineffective. The reality warping powers were unstable and inconsistent. A faint distortion in the surroundings occurred, but it had no substantial impact on @kaybeden's Cobot. It appeared that @kazanan's grasp on reality was still uncertain.	@kazanan's REALITY WARPER was barely effective. The reality warping powers managed to create minor distortions in space and time. A momentary disruption occurred, causing some confusion for @kaybeden's Cobot, but it quickly adapted and regained its bearings.	@kazanan's REALITY WARPER was effective. The reality warping powers materialized significant alterations in the battlefield. Spatial anomalies and temporal shifts disoriented @kaybeden's Cobot, making it challenging to respond effectively to further attacks.	@kazanan's REALITY WARPER was very effective. The reality warping powers were fully harnessed, reshaping the battlefield to @kaybeden's disadvantage. @kaybeden's Cobot found itself trapped in a nightmarish reality, facing impossible odds and insurmountable obstacles. The overwhelming changes proved fatal.
					
					
SUPER DUPER PLANET BLOWER	@kazanan's SUPER DUPER PLANET BLOWER was impotent.
