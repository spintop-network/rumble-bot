        'Welcome to Spintop’s Cobot Rumble! If I am correct, you want to prove yourself as a capable pilot and win the big prize. That’s fine, but let me remind you this: this is no place for fragile people. You will destroy or be destroyed; there’s nothing in between.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'When you register to be a pilot by pressing the “Register” button, you’ll be given the “Novice Pilot” role. With your new assigned role, you are officially ready to kickstart your journey as a Cobot pilot! You will be ready, but the event starts on Wednesday, the 6th of December, so you’ll have to wait a little while. Registrations will conclude on the 6th of December, which means no one can register after the 6th of December. After completing your registration process by pressing the “Register” button, visit the #pilots-handbook channel to learn more about Spintop’s Cobot Rumble! Also, you can chill with other pilots on #pilots-lounge and even learn some tricks while developing strategies by chatting with experienced pilots.\n' +

      'Let me give you some idea about what will happen next. You are now an official pilot, ready to get your hands dirty. You got your Cobot, your gigantic cooperative war machine robot, and you’ll face other Cobot pilots with it. However, the event occurs on Spintop’s Discord channel, and you don’t actually own a Cobot. Still, thanks to the artificial dimension I’ve created, I can picture everything for you and tell you what is happening in the artificial dimension where Cobot’s Steam Arena (sponsored by BITS Artificial Services) is located. You take action on Discord by pressing some buttons, and I’ll let you know the reflection of your actions within the artificial dimension I’ve created. As you understand, you need me desperately to navigate. I’ll provide the information to you without twisting it. You can position me as your bridge between Discord and the artificial dimension, so listening to every word I say to know what’s happening in Spintop’s Cobot Rumble is crucial. Do you understand? Is it too complicated for you to understand? I don’t care, and I am moving on.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The idea of Spintop’s Cobot Rumble is simple, even for you: destroy every opponent you face. You can use different types of weapons and armor to bring your opponents to their knees, and these equipable items can be bought from the Armory if you have enough Credits. Credits are only usable in artificial dimensions and can be earned by defeating opponents only. Or, if you are lucky, you might find some in Random Encounters. Oh, yes, Random Encounters. Between shopping for weapons and armor from the Armory and battling against other Cobot pilots, you have a third option, which I call Random Encounters. If you want to experience a Random Encounter, you will press the button written “Random Encounters” on it, just as you will do with the Armory and Battle buttons. But let me remind you, Random Encounters are really random. Its outcome can be disastrous or miraculous for you and your Cobot. So tread accordingly.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“But BITS, everything sounds suspiciously awesome. Isn’t there a catch?” There is, of course. In the artificial dimension I’ve created, each action you take will cost an Energy Point (EP), and you have 6 of them. You have to wait 4 hours for an Energy Point to regenerate. I had to implement this energy system because otherwise, there would be vast amounts of glitches all over the artificial dimension, and to be honest, I don’t want to ruin what I’ve created just to be able to entertain you. Deal with it, and use your Energy Points wisely.\n'
